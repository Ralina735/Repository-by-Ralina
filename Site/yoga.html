			<div class="title1"> Intelligence, memory, and concentration are human traits that are highly valued and sought after. 
				There are various yogic techniques that stimulate the brain and nervous system to improve memory and concentration, which can lead to higher intelligence. 
				These practices were initially created to help one enter and sustain a state of meditation, but these yogic concentration exercises will also improve your
				 mental focus, awareness, and memory. Regular and consistent practice of one or more of these practices will boost your overall cognitive abilities, which in turn
				  will strengthen your willpower, resolve, and resilience to overcome difficulty and challenge.  </div>
